# SAI Challenger
SAI testing and integration framework for any SAI oriented devices. The main ideas behind SAI-Challenger are:
- testbed agnostic test cases - test case code does not require any changes for running in any type of environment - HW, emulation, different test equipment, links, servers, etc.;
- decoupling real SAI RPC implementation from test cases code - test code looks similar for configuring device using Thrift, Redis, etc.;
- traffic generator agnostic interface - possibility to use both SW and HW traffic generators that support snappi API;
- fully dockerized environment;


## SAI Challenger sources

To get SAI Challenger sources:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI-Challenger.git
cd SAI-Challenger/
git submodule update --init
```
# Applications
SAI Challenger has many applications. A partial list is below:
* Virtual and Physical testbeds
* Testing and debugging libsai using saithrift, independent of any Network Operating System (NOS)
* SONiC-SAI Integration and test using sairedis
* CI/CD and regression testing of virtual or physical DUTs
* DUT performance testing using HW traffic generators
* PHY (transceiver) device testing & qualification
* Ubrella test harness for native SAI Challenger test cases as well as legacy SAI-PTF test cases, using a single-pane-of-glass to reduce testbed complexity.

# Use-case scenarios
SAI Challenger has many configuration options, resulting in numerous permutations of:
* Physical or virtual DUT testing
* DUT Configuration APIs - saithrift or sairedis
* Dataplane (packet test) - PTF/Scapy or OTG/snappi.

See [Use-Cases README](usecases/README.md) for more details.
