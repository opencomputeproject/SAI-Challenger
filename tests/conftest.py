    This code defines a hook, which is executed after each phase
    of a test execution and is responsible for creating a test report.

    The "when" attribute of the test report represents the phase of the test:
      - "setup": the report is generated during the setup phase of the test.
      - "call": the report is generated during the actual execution of the test.
      - "teardown": the report is generated during the teardown phase of the test.

    The outcome of a test can have the following possible values:
      - "passed": the test has passed successfully.
      - "failed": the test has failed.
      - "skipped": the test was skipped intentionally.
      - "error": an unexpected error occurred during the test execution.
      - "xfailed": the test was expected to fail, and it actually failed as expected.
      - "xpassed": the test was expected to fail, but it passed unexpectedly.
